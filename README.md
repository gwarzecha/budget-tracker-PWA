  # Budget Tracker
  

  
  ## Description: 

  Budget Tracker is an app (PWA) that allows the user to track any money that is gained or spent. It lists the expenses and provides a graph with a visual of the user's spending over a period of time. The app utilizes `IndexedDB` to cache network requests when offline and submit them when a network connection becomes available again. It also utilizes `Express.js` for server instantiation, `MongoDB` for its database, and `Mongoose` for model creation.
